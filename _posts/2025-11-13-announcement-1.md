Hi all,

I am working on moving this project to GitHub to automate its build process. 

If you receive this message at around 6:00PM PST, it means everything is working as expected. 

We are currently on chapter 4, which you should have received today at around 4:00PM. 

Chapter 5 should be in your inbox tomorrow evening. 

Thanks,
Pablo
